# Chapter 10

`page fault` -> memory page not actually in memory but on disk somewhere

`non-resident-memory` -> memory that's not paged in

`secondary memory` = swap space

`anonymous memory` -> memory not associated something on the file system (ie stack/heap)

Copy on write for virtual memory is awesome.

`working set` -> approximation of program's locality/currently used set of pages

The sum of all working sets is used to calculate number of running processes scheduled in conjunction with CPU utilization.

`slab` -> preallocated block of memory for a specific kernel data structure

Look into ARM TLB architecture stuff. How does it affect performance? Niche use cases?

Does anyone use inverted page tables?

10.9.5 Program Structure -> Reminds me of php bad times

Windows memory management is WILDLY different. I wonder:

* How this effects performance

Solaris really went all in on the "clock" thing.
