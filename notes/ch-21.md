# Chapter 21

```Since 2001, chips from both Intel and AMD have allowed memory pages to be marked so that they cannot contain executable instruction code. The Windows DEP feature marks stacks and memory heaps (as well as all other data only allocations) so that they cannot be used to execute code. This prevents attacks in which a program bug allows a buffer to overflow and then is tricked into executing the contents of the buffer. Additionally, starting with Windows 8.1, all kernel data-only memory allocations have been marked similarly.```

This sounds dope. Compare against Linux

```One of the most significant improvements in the Windows experience came from adding memory diagnostics as an option at boot time. This addition is especially valuable because so few consumer PCs have error-correcting memory. Bad RAM that lacks error correction and detection can change the data it storesâ€”a change undetected by the hardware. The result is frustratingly erratic behavior in the system. The availability of memory diagnostics can warn users of a RAM problem. Windows 10 took this even further by introducing run time memory diagnostics. If a machine encounters a kernel-mode crash more than five times in a row, and the crashes cannot be pinpointed to a specific cause or component, the kernel will use idle periods to move memory contents, flush system caches, and write repeated memory-testing patterns in all memory all to preemptively discover if RAM is damaged. Users can then be informed of any issues without the need to reboot into the memory diagnostics tool at boot time.```

Fancy.

Interesting they included the bit about metric collection.

Now knowing all we do the fact that they added a whole mobile OS like layer into Windows 8 is even more bonkers.

The three layers of vmx/secure/user or whatever is strange. So much user space drivers, and a strange proxy layer?

Non preemptable "dispatcher" is an interesting take.

Threads having both a user and kernel pieces is strange

Should look into OS personalities, Pico Providers, User Mode Scheduling, Clock/Tick differences vs Linux

Superfetch sounds silly.

Even more complicated memory.

Jobs almost sound like cgroups

Cache Manager is cool

App containers and security stuff is strange.

The boot process is wild
