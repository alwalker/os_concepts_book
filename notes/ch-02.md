# Chapter 2

## OS Views

1. Services that the system provides
2. Users/programmer
3. Components and their interconnections.

Services: Everything from a UI to to syscalls to a filesystem to "security".

```Most operating systems, including Linux, UNIX, and Windows, treat the command interpreter as a special program that is running when a process is initiated```

This ^ explains some things. You can't have a process running w/o a shell and therefore w/o stdin/out/err etc?

Interrupts can be traps and traps can be interrupts? Single Step is an interrupt?

```The allow user() and deny user() system calls specify whether particular users can—or cannot—be allowed access to certain resources```

I'm excited to dig into this ^ and what the user boundary is between kernel and user space.

## Linkers and Loaders

This section was fun

```We shall see in Chapter 9 that it is possible for multiple processes to share dynamically linked libraries, resulting in a significant savings in memory use.```

This is dope where is it in atop? Also, security?

```In addition, although operating systems are large, only a small amount of the code is critical to high performance; the interrupt handlers, I/O manager, memory manager, and CPU scheduler are probably the most critical routines. After the system is written and is working correctly, bottlenecks can be identified and can be refactored to operate more efficiently.```

This is a great bit. Figure out what's important, get that right, iterate on the rest.

## Structure

```Everything below the system-call interface and above the physical hardware is the kernel. The kernel provides the file system, CPU scheduling, memory management, and other operating-system functions through system calls. Taken in sum, that is an enormous amount of functionality to be combined into one single address space.```

```The Linux kernel is monolithic in that it runs entirely in kernel mode in a single address space, but as we shall see in Section 2.8.4, it does have a modular design that allows the kernel to be modified during run time.```

^ well yes, but no.meme

```There is little consensus regarding which services should remain in the kernel and which should be implemented in user space```

^ Sounds about right.

```Typically, however, microkernels provide minimal process and memory management, in addition to a communication facility.```

This makes microkernels as an application hosting/platform solution make so much more sense.

QNX again!!!

Windows NT started as a micro kernel, who knew?!

`LKMs` = Loadable Kernel Modules. Remember Ferrol rant now. Is this I/O kit on MacOS?

```To address such performance problems, Darwin combines Mach, BSD, the I/O kit, and any kernel extensions into a single address space.```

This sounds like chaos.

I really like these alternating colour block diagrams

Mobile OS (and macOS) seem to be traditional kernel plus one and only one way to do hardware "things" like audio and graphics. Or to put it another way a kernel + a new higher level set of one tru syscalls. Or in Linux you don't HAVE to use glibc, but in this case you would have to.

```The standard C library used by Linux systems is the GNU C library (glibc). Google instead developed the Bionic standard C library for Android. Not only does Bionic have a smaller memory footprint than glibc, but it also has been designed for the slower CPUs that characterize mobile devices. (In addition, Bionic allows Google to bypass GPL licensing of glibc.)```

Didn't know this ^

## Building and Booting

```During the boot process, the boot loader typically creates a temporary RAM file system, known as initramfs.```

Makes sense but now I know. Kernel modules go here, that makes even more sense.

## Debugging

```A common technique is to save the kernel’s memory state to a section of disk set aside for this purpose that contains no file system```

Where is this?!

```Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.```

Brilliant

eBPF -> how the fancy arm stuff works? It def makes that big graph of troubleshooting tools make more sense

## Misc

The ARM docs are wild. They feel like they're written for people who already know ARM.

## WED NIGHT

* The programming assignments
* Poke at or talk BCC
* Prep LFS VM
* Cleanup binaries and commit chapter 2
