## Learning Words

superblocks!
Extents!
Clusters! But less so
Ntfs sounds like sql
buffer/cache



Linked allocation reliability problem is interesting

I can see why fat was awesome in the 80s

Multilevel index blocks make file size limits make sense

Look at inode structure per file system

None of these allocation/tracking algorithms look like my memory management algorithm... except counting


```When a process closes the file, the per-process table entry is removed, and the system-wide entryâ€™s open count is decremented. Then all users that have opened the file close it, any updated metadata are copied back to the disk-based directory structure, and the system-wide open-file table entry is removed. ```

power loss?

```The minimum mass of a device capable of storing 2^128 bytes using atomic-level storage would be about 272 trillion kilograms```

How different allocation algorithms respond to crashes was an interesting though

Journaling comes from databases...probably should have known this

A root inode helps make snapshots seem more feasible

Lookup wafl vs zfs vs btrfs vs lvm snapshots
