# Chapter 3

```Each time a function is called, an activation record containing function parameters, local variables, and the return address is pushed onto the stack; when control is returned from the function, the activation record is popped from the stack.```

I thought this was just a convention for assembly programming, I did't realize it carried over to everything. (Possibly due to the way the processor actually works?)

`size` result doesn't match up with book

See if we can find the `process control block` in the linux kernel (its in the book)

Time slices bitch!

`swapping` not heard of this before

```Context-switch time is pure overhead, because the system does no useful work while switching.```

Ya don't say... Also, that diagram is awesome. Show to Chuck/Ethan

```Switching speed varies from machine to machine, depending on the memory speed, the number of registers that must be copied, and the existence of special instructions (such as a single instruction to load or store all registers). A typical speed is a several microseconds```

Look this up in intel docs

Love the mobile OS multitasking bit

```We use the term process rather loosely in this situation, as Linux prefers the term task instead.```

News to me

The fork example program makes so much more sense now. Try to do this in rust/c/go and compare strace?

The windows fork example would imply that the parent process has a lot more info about the child by default than linux. The `si` and `ps` structs. Does this mean more memory usage?

```In fact, under normal termination, exit() will be called either directly (as shown above) or indirectly, as the C run-time library (which is added to UNIX executable files) will include a call to exit() by default.```

Calling it a run-time helps put things in perspective

Love the chrome example

Didn't even consider the direct message passing example to not have an abstraction for process name/id

That mach message passing shit was wild. Port rights is a dumb name

Ol' Windows named pipes. For some reason I associate this with SQL Server

RPC section seemed to vague to be useful? But explains JMI/Java Remoting. Also Android example not great.
