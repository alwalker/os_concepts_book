# Chapter 18

```Hardware-based solutions that provide support for virtual machine creation and management via firmware. These VMMs, which are commonly found in mainframe and large to midsized servers, are generally known as type 0 hypervisors. IBM LPARs and Oracle LDOMs are examples.```

Not heard of this outside of smart NICs etc. Should look into it.

```Virtual machines first appeared commercially on IBM mainframes in 1972.```

Well I'll be damned.

```First, the VMM sets up protection domains to tell the CPU which physical memory belongs to each guest. Next, it assigns the I/O devices to the protection domains, allowing them direct access to those memory regions and only those regions. The hardware then transforms the address in a DMA request issued by an I/O device to the host physical memory address associated with the I/O.```

This is dope as hell.

Xen seems wild.

```Commonly, the time-of-day clocks in virtual machines are incorrect because timers take longer to trigger than they would on dedicated CPUs. Virtualization can thus undo the scheduling-algorithm efforts of the operating systems within virtual machines.```

Boyyyyy does it. Insert ftp assignment story here.

Balloon memory management is also dope.

Its crazy that memory deduping is effecting...kinda

```Partitioning hypervisors partition the existing machine physical resources amongst guests, thereby fully committing rather than overcommitting machine resources. Partitioning hypervisors can securely extend the features of an existing operating system via functionality in another operating system (run in a separate guest VM domain), running on a subset of machine physical resources. This avoids the tedium of writing an entire operating system from scratch. For example, a Linux system that lacks real-time capabilities for safety- and security-critical tasks can be extended with a lightweight real-time operating system running in its own virtual machine.```

Never thought about it this way, that's really cool.

Look into these `seperation hypervisors`
